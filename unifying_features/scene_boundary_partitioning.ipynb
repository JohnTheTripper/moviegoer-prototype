    "# Scene Boundary Paritioning\n",
    "Movies are comprised of self-contained units called scenes. Scenes have a beginning and end, usually comprised of a single conversation. They most often take place in one location with a fixed number of characters. By identifying scenes in a movie, we can then begin to analyze them individually, most notably by treating a scenes's dialogue as a freestanding, indepdent conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll just be identifying two-character dialogue scenes. These are the most basic building-blocks of films: just two characters speaking together with no distractions, purely advancing the plot with their dialogue. In modern filmmaking, these scenes are usually shot in a specific manner. We can take advantage of this by looking for specific patterns of shots, to identify a few two-character dialogue scenes."
